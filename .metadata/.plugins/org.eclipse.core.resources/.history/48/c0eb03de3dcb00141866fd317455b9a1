	// Just wondering, why do you use dim as a template
	//because i am creating a general files for 1, 2 and 3 dimensions in
	//space
	// But dim could just be a parameter in the constructor?
	//no, leave it
	// What is the advantage?
	////leave it.
	//i dont want to pass it to every function
	//there will be many
	// Nojust store it in a members in the constructor
	// Because, though c++ provides these, it is a weird use of templates
	// and I haven't seem this before deal_II
	//u solve the error first
